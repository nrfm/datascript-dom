# datascript-dom

A Clojure experiment to use datascript to perform DOM-like queries on
HTML.

This is not a library, just a monolithic namespace that defines some
functions and also contains a huge comment with expressions that are
meant to be eval'ed one by one in the REPL for experimentation. There
are also a couple of unit tests.

For further explanation, see [this blog post](http://blog.juxt.pro/posts/datascript-dom.html).
